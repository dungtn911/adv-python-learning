The first case of the 2019â€“20 coronavirus pandemic in India was reported
on 30 January 2020, originating from China. As of 21 April 2020, the
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare have confirmed a total of 18,985
cases, 3,260 recoveries (including 1 migration) and 603 deaths in the
country.[5] Experts suggest the number of infections could be much
higher as India's testing rates are among the lowest in the world.[8]
The infection rate of COVID-19 in India is reported to be 1.7,
significantly lower than in the worst affected countries.[9]
